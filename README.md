# Design Patterns

Hi! This repository is both a way to exercise design patterns implementation 
and a future extra help to anyone who would like to find cool samples 
of design patterns implementation, so... 
welcome! And feel free to read and contribute :)

I'll make a CONTRIBUTING.md later... I think

Anyway, what are design patterns?
